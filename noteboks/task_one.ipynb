    "**Subject:** Business Understanding & Approach for PowerCo Churn Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Dear Associate Director,  \n",
    "\n",
    "I hope you are doing well. Following our discussion regarding PowerCo's concerns about customer churn, Estelle and I have outlined our approach to understand and investigate this issue using the data science methodology.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Problem Formulation Using the Data Science Process**\n",
    "1. **Business Understanding:** PowerCo, a major gas and electricity utility, is experiencing customer churn as SMEs switch to other providers. A key hypothesis is that price sensitivity significantly influences customer retention.  \n",
    "2. **Data Understanding:** We need to collect and analyze relevant customer and market data to assess the impact of pricing and other factors on churn.  \n",
    "3. **Data Preparation:** Cleaning, transforming, and ensuring the data is structured for effective analysis.  \n",
    "4. **Modeling & Analysis:** Utilizing statistical and machine learning techniques to identify key churn predictors.  \n",
    "5. **Evaluation & Insights:** Validating findings and providing actionable recommendations to mitigate churn.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Factors Influencing Churn**\n",
    "Potential reasons customers may stay with or leave PowerCo include:  \n",
    "- **Price Sensitivity:** Competitor pricing, rate changes, and billing patterns.  \n",
    "- **Service Quality:** Reliability, customer support response time, and issue resolution.  \n",
    "- **Contract Terms:** Length, renewal conditions, and hidden charges.  \n",
    "- **Energy Source Preferences:** Interest in clean/renewable energy.  \n",
    "- **Business Demographics:** Industry type, location, and operational scale.  \n",
    "- **Customer Engagement:** Interaction frequency, complaints, and loyalty programs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Required Data**\n",
    "To investigate these factors, we propose gathering the following datasets:  \n",
    "- **Customer Demographics:** Business type, size, industry, and location.  \n",
    "- **Billing & Pricing Data:** Historical billing records, tariff changes, and customer tenure.  \n",
    "- **Churn Status:** Retained vs. churned customers.  \n",
    "- **Competitor Data:** Market rates, promotions, and alternative service offerings.  \n",
    "- **Customer Support Interactions:** Complaints, service tickets, and response times.  \n",
    "- **Renewable Energy Adoption Rates:** If applicable, customer preferences for green energy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Analysis & Visualization Approach**\n",
    "- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Summary statistics and correlation analysis to identify key trends.  \n",
    "- **Customer Segmentation:** Clustering methods to identify churn-prone groups.  \n",
    "- **Time Series Analysis:** To assess trends in churn rate over time.  \n",
    "- **Predictive Modeling:** Logistic regression, decision trees, or machine learning models to predict churn probability.  \n",
    "- **Visualization:** Dashboards with churn heatmaps, price sensitivity charts, and customer retention trends.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We look forward to your feedback on this approach. Please let us know if you require any adjustments or additional considerations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Best regards,  \n",
